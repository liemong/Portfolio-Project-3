# Bike Sales Dashboard

## Data Set Overview
The Excel file contains both the original data set and the cleaned data set. The data consists of customer data relating to things like their marital status,  income, education, occupation and other elements and whether or not they had purchased a bike.

## Methodology
1. Create a copy of the data in 'Working Sheet' so that if we make any mistakes we can refer to the original data.
2. Remove any duplicates with 'Remove Duplicates' under the Data tab.
3. Use 'Find and Replace'.
   Search by column and replace 'S' with 'Single' and 'M' with 'Married' in the Married column.
   Search by column and replace 'M' with 'Male' and 'F' with 'Female' in the Gender column.
4. Make sure Currency is all set to Currency and remove decimals places to make it look cleaner.
5. Create new column for Age groups and split into 3 groups 'Young 0-30', 'Middle Age 31-54' and 'Old 55+'.
6. Create pivot tables and use them for visualisations.
7. Combine visuals into dashboard and make filters.
